If I had a spirit animal, it would have probably been a ‚Äúhappy squirrel on redbull‚Äù. Popular culture would suggest meditation to mellow out the rough edges. I had always found the promises of meditation to feel too much like snake oil to trust its effectiveness. A combination of low risk, and wanting to fairly eliminate it as a useful tool, I wanted to give it an honest try. Half measures would have always felt that I may have left some stone unturned. To counter this self doubt and to give meditation the best chance of success, I decided to jump into the deep end and do a 10 day meditation course. This was done in complete silence without communicating with anyone living a monk-like existence. I figured that if the course experience was good, I would learn how to meditate correctly‚Ä¶ and if it failed I would have gotten a 10 day break from the world. Heads I win, and tails I don‚Äôt lose; the best way to gamble üòõ.

What did this involve?
======
We were required to 
 * not talk, look at, or communicate with anyone. 
 * not read, write, or listen to any audiobook, music, or any form of entertainment.
 * follow a frugal vegetarian diet.
 * meditate as much as possible.
 * temporarily pause any daily rituals one was used to doing.


You can have many headings
======

Aren't headings cool?
