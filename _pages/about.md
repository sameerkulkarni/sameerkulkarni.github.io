Hi, I’m Sameer Kulkarni, an engineer and investor driven by curiosity, systems thinking, and impact.

By day, I work on advanced machine learning systems at Google DeepMind, pushing the frontier of AI research and its real-world applications. By night (and weekends), I operate a portfolio of short-term and multifamily rental properties that blends data-driven decision-making with hospitality and design. I also have a deep-rooted passion for education, having taught AP Biology and mentored students in research and competition science.

I thrive at the intersection of technology, real estate, and education — whether optimizing a neural network, designing an Airbnb experience, or helping young minds connect scientific theory with real-world action.

This site is a home for my research, writing, and projects — from AI experiments to real estate insights and educational tools.
