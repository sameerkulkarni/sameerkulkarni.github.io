Use a machine learning model to predict an effective sequence of compiler optimizations on a per-method basis within a dynamic compiler. By formulating the phase-ordering problem as a Markov process and using neuro-evolution to build a predictive model, this technique achieves significant speedups over the well-engineered fixed optimization order in Jikes RVM.
