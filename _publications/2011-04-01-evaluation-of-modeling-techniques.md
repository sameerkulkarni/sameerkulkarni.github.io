Evaluate and compare three different machine learning techniques for their effectiveness in iterative compilation. This work introduces a novel "tournament predictor" that outperforms state-of-the-art predictors by framing the problem as a pairwise comparison of optimization sequences, achieving an average of 75% improvement over the Open64 compiler's most aggressive setting.
