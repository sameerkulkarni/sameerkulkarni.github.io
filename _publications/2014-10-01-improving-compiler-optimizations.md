Use machine learning to navigate the complex search space of compiler optimizations. Automatically construct heuristics and solve the phase-ordering problem to achieve significant performance improvements over traditional compiler designs. This work demonstrates that machine learning models can successfully predict effective sequences of compiler optimizations, outperforming default compiler settings.
