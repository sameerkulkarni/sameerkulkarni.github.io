Use neuro-evolution to automatically generate function inlining heuristics. This work shows that the generated heuristics outperform expertly-tuned, manual heuristics in the HotSpot Java Virtual Machine by learning from a diverse set of static code features, achieving speedups of up to 89%. The research also demonstrates how to create more readable heuristics in the form of decision trees.
