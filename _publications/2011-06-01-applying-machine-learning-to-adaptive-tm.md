Apply machine learning to build adaptive transactional memory (TM) systems. This preliminary work shows that a model can effectively learn to choose the best TM algorithm for a given workload by using dynamic profiling to gather program characteristics, providing a baseline for future research into adaptive TM mechanisms.
